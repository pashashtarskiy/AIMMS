### 🧠 Mission
AIMMS is an open, transparent metadata standard for AI-assisted music.  
Its goal is to create ethical, technical, and legal clarity between:
- human artists,  
- AI tools,  
- listeners, and  
- digital distribution platforms.

## 🎯 Mission
AIMMS (Artificial Intelligence Music Metadata Standard) is an open initiative to create a unified, transparent and ethical framework for describing, distributing, and attributing music created **with** or **by** artificial intelligence.

Our goal is to help artists, developers, labels, and distributors speak one common language — through standardized metadata fields that define authorship, creative contribution, and AI involvement.

## 🧩 Why It Matters
The music industry is facing chaos:
- No clear rules for identifying AI-assisted works.
- Distributors have inconsistent policies — some reject AI music, others charge extra.
- Artists are unsure how to disclose their use of AI tools.
- Listeners lack transparency about what they hear.

AIMMS proposes a **metadata-based solution**, not a legal one — a technical layer for clarity, trust, and accountability.

## 🧱 Core Principles

1. **Transparency by Design**  
   Every track should include metadata fields defining which elements were created by AI and which by humans.

2. **Creator-Centric Ownership**  
   If the creative intent, structure, and supervision belong to the artist, the track is *artist-owned* — even if AI tools are involved.

3. **Interoperability**  
   The format should be compatible wi
